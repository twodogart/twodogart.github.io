	  Gail Hunter is a GARNA award winning photographer whose photos have
	  appeared in her local newspaper, The Mountain Mail. A geographer and
	  nature enthusiast, her photography is not edited. She relies solely
	  on her skill of embracing the natural light to capture images. The
	  magical colors of her work are often found during her favorite daily
	  ritual, walking her dogs to the songs of the sunrise. As a former
	  runner, Gail now enjoys a slower pace which allows time for photos.
	  Gail is a retired attorney, the mother of four children and
	  grandmother of five, and lives in Salida, Colorado.
